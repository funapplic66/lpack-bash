# Test lpack.bash

This directory contains a test HTML with basic JS and CSS to test if this works for your machine.

Just run on terminal:

```
../lpack.bash lbry-test test.lbry
```

Now check if there is a `test.lbry` file in this directory. If there is, the script is working. You can upload the .lbry file to LBRY to check if it is working for you.
